Blastlight - pending item ID
Low profile - moderate danger

Blastlight is a combat machine mounted on the decaying corpse of an unidentified male. The mount includes a large spot light repurposed into a head and is capable of firing blinding blasts of light and disorienting strobes. Blastlight also has a powerful speaker capable of emitting sonic blasts, and sharp metallic fingers which can cause serious damage. While these traits make blastlight a serious danger, they rely on a battery with an insufficient lifespan, and these attacks only serve to shorten that lifespan limiting their danger.

Blastlight is a capable problem solver and skilled in wiring, having on occasion recharged their battery by disconnecting some of their wiring and attaching it to other machines. But beyond that is rudimentary at best, being unable to understand words, confused by simple commands, and overwhelmed by large groups. Blastlight once examined an apple for several hours and was astonished when the owner of said apple ate it. Most situations they struggle to navigate results in violent outbursts, both against those around them and themself.

Blastlight was discovered in an abandoned building deep in the Appalachian mountains, along side several other similar creatures, of which they were the only repairable instance. The facility was scrubbed of all information on its owners and inhabitants long before Notch Foundation agents discovered it, but several blueprints depicting blastlight and their siblings. We tried to identify a designer but the blueprints matched nobody on record.

Blastlight is currently held in a warehouse Asheville North Carolina, left inactive indefinitely after an outburst that left an employee dead and 3 others in critical condition.
