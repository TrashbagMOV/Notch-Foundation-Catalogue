Dog Man is a male hybrid between a Germanic human and a doberman. He shares physical characteristics of both humans and canines but is mostly human mentally. His IQ is only 62 and only babbles in broken German.

Discovered in a forest off the side of the Autobahn, he is thought to be the product of experiments by Malum Pharmaceuticals of Europe to create guards for their facilities. Though this is only speculation as there is no concrete evidence of this theory. Dog Man was discovered by a DCI agent responding to reports of feral people wandering the forest. Once captured, he was handed of to the Notch Foundation.

Dog Man stands at 6’3 and weighs 293 pounds, he can dead lift around 450 and has a bite force of 223 psi. He has been considered for the Notch Foundation Rehabilitation Program but has failed to make promising growth and was ejected from the program.
