(No photo on record)

Dog Man is a male hybrid between a Germanic human, DNA tests were inconclusive beyond that, and a doberman. He shares physical and mental characteristics of both humans and canines, and shows signs of extreme neurological damage only babbling in broken German.

Discovered November 29th 2004 in a forest off the side of the Autobahn, he is thought to be the product of experiments by Malum Pharmaceuticals of Europe to create guards for their facilities. Though this is only speculation as there is no concrete evidence of this theory. Dog Man was discovered by a DCI agent responding to reports of feral people wandering the forest. Once captured, he was handed off to the Notch Foundation. He stands at 6’3 and weighs 293 pounds, he can dead lift ~450 and has a bite force of ~223 psi. He has been considered for the Notch Foundation Rehabilitation Program but has failed to make promising growth and was ejected from the program.

Dog Man is currently held in The Hannover Rehabilitation Camp, pending transfer to the Hannover Intensive-care Facility. And as of March 9th 2006 Dog Man has been under consideration for euthanasia, requested by Dr. Weber.
