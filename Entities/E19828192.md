Faux Houses - E19828192
Moderate profile, low danger
(Sketch of a Faux House instance)

Faux Houses are a species of building mimics originating from subspace L19828191, “Gumption Nevada”. They typically resemble windowless tan houses, and in place of a door there is simply a dark void.

When something enters a Faux House, it is consumed and eventually used to reproduce, though they do not need food to survive. They will de-manifest if enough damage is sustained.

Faux Houses were discovered when a large subspace was found in the Nevada desert on August 19th 1982. The whole subspace consisted of Faux Houses, and they were only found there until the subspace was de-manifested by the Notch Foundation survey crew who was sent in. Afterwards, sightings popped up all over the Western United States and northern Mexico.
