# Escopofobia – I1968070801

Low profile, low danger.

Escopofobia is the title of a painting by an anonymous painter believed to be behind several other sets of memetic paintings.
As with other pieces in the series, titled “A galeria dos medos”, the piece has a seemingly benign appearance. Depicting a pair of brown eyes on a soft blue background.
Much like its siblings; Escopofobia inflicts its viewers with several symptoms, such as:

- Scopophobia

- Hallucinations of disembodied eyes

- Anxiety

- Confusion

- Hallucinations of indistinct figures

for 10-16 hours, increasing in strength overtime. When the piece is viewed again, symptoms become stronger, and can last longer.
Alongside the rest of A galeria dos medos, Escopofobia was discovered on July 7th 1968 on the opening night of Casa de Belas Artes de Paraty’s new wing. And was taken into Notch Foundation custody early the next morning.
A galeria dos medos is thought to be by the unnamed painter known to the Notch Foundation as P1944121901, who may have also been behind several prior stand alone pieces that popped up all across south America.
Escoptofobia is currently stored in warehouse-219B, pending relocation to a testing facility.
