“David the Archangel” or David Young is a 5’10 190 pound caucasian male born April 9th 1992 to Lola and Henry Young. David was born with several angelic characteristics, such as wings, a halo
 and dozens of eyes all over his body.

Direct eye contact with these extra eyes will lead to severe psychological damage and in some cases death. After killing both his parents and several hospital staff, the extra eyes were sewn shut and David was abandoned outside the hospital.

He was homeless for 7 years before being inducted into the Notch Foundation Rehabilitation Program on the 30th of November, 1999. Since then, he has had the eyes removed and his skin repaired and several surgeries to remove the bone structures of the wings from his back. And is expected to leave the program by 2016.
