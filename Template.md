Description (at least 1 paragraph)

Nickname could be its actual name, a good descriptor, something like that. The ID starts with a letter, I for ITEM P for PERSON E for ENTITY L for LOCATION O for ORGANISATION etc. The year month and day are when the item was catalouged, not necisarily when they first appeared/when they were discovered. the number at the end is if multiple items have that date, and is sequential. UNLESS the item predates Notch Foundation involvment in the anomalous (~1896) in which case pick the date of the first recorded sighting. Also, if the document itself is older than the Notch Foundation, it would probably be a gonvernment document, or DCI document

There's Low, Medium, High, Extreme, and Existential Threats and Profiles. Profiles are just how noticable it is.

Images could be sketches or photos of the item.
